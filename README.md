# Task 1: Fourth SIGMORPHON Shared Task on Grapheme-to-Phoneme Conversions
In this task, participants will create computational models that map native orthography lemmas ("graphemes") to valid IPA transcriptions of phonemic pronunciation. This task is crucial for speech processing, namely text-to-speech synthesis.

## Results
Final results will be reported here by August 15, 2024.  System papers and a summary of the task will appear in the SIGMORPHON 2024 proceedings.

## Data
### Source
The data is scraped from [Wiktionary](https://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/Wiktionary:Main_Page) using [WikiPron](https://github.com/kylebgorman/wikipron) (Lee et al. 2020). Data is augmented with IPA transcriptions produced by GPT. All data is validated by organizers.

### Format
Training and development data found in the `data/tsv` folder, separated by orthographic system. For each orthographic system, we include subdirectories for individual language sets and a subdirectory for the concatenation of languages. Datasets are UTF-8-encoded tab-separated values files. Each example occupies a single line and consists of a grapheme sequence—a sequence of [NFC](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Unicode_equivalence#Normal_forms) Unicode codepoints—a tab character, and the corresponding phone sequence, a roughly-phonemic IPA, tokenized using the [segments]() library.

### Subtasks
There are three subtasks, which will be scored separately. Participant teams may submit as many systems as they want to as many subtasks as they want.

In all three subtasks, the data is randomly split into training (80%), development (10%), and testing (10%) data.

(N.B. Due to quality concerns, the originally planned Devanagari-based subset was removed from the task. We will release this dataset later for community use.)

#### Subtask 1: Multilingual G2P (Shared Orthography):

Participants will be provided three multilingual training sets. Each dataset will be composed of languages utilizing the same orthography (Roman, Cyrillic, Arabic). For evaluation, each training set will be paired with a test set, with each test set composed of samples from the training languages along with an additional unseen language of the same orthography. Models in this track will be tasked to evaluate per training-test dataset pairing (i.e. models are trained on one orthography at a time).

The evaluation languages for Task 1 are (surprise language in *italics*):

Abjad:
- Modern Standard Arabic
- Farsi
- Pashto
- Urdu
- *South Levantine Arabic*

Cyrillic:
- Bulgarian
- Macedonian
- Russian
- Ukranian
- *Serbo-Croatian*

Latin:
- English
- Indonesian
- Spanish
- Tagalog
- *Hungarian*

Data for Subtask 1 is found in the folder `data/eval/task_1`. Each evaluation set is grouped by orthography system. (i.e. `{latin/cyrillic/abjad}_test.tsv`.) We also provide per language evaluation sets.

#### Subtask 2: Multilingual G2P (Restricted Orthography):

Participants will be provided three multilingual training sets using the same script constraints as seen in Task 1. Provided these datasets, participants will be allowed to train over the concatenation of all data (or subset of) for single evaluation on the concatenation of all test datasets in Task 1. That is, the subtask will evaluate model ability to utilize mixed-orthography scripts for downstream evaluation.

Data for Subtask 2 is found in the folder `data/eval/task_2`. Each evaluation set is grouped by orthography system. (i.e. `{latin/cyrillic/abjad}_test.tsv`.) We also provide per language evaluation sets. (Note, this is the same data as used for Subtask 1 and is copied for convenience.)

#### Subtask 3: Multilingual G2P (Unknown Orthography):

This task will function similarly to Task 2 but all unseen languages in the test set will be replaced with languages with orthographies distinct from all other scripts present in the preceding two tasks. For fairness, script systems will be chosen such that they are functionally similar to the training scripts (e.g. the unseen Arabic languages will be replaced with other Abjad).

Abjad:
- Modern Standard Arabic
- Farsi
- Pashto
- Urdu
- *Hebrew*

Cyrillic:
- Bulgarian
- Macedonian
- Russian
- Ukranian
- *Romanian*

Latin:
- English
- Indonesian
- Spanish
- Tagalog
- *Mongolian*

Data for Subtask 3 is found in the folder `data/eval/task_3`. Each evaluation set is grouped by orthography system. (i.e. `{latin/cyrillic/abjad}_test.tsv`.) We also provide per language evaluation sets.

## Evaluation
The metric used to rank systems is word error rate (WER), the percentage of words for which the hypothesized transcription sequence does not match the gold transcription. This value, in accordance with common practice, is a decimal value multiplied by 100 (e.g.: 13.53). In the medium- and low-frequency tasks, WER is macro-averaged across all ten languages. We provide two Python scripts for evaluation:

[evaluate.py]() computes the WER for one language.
[evaluate_all.py]() computes per-language and average WER across multiple languages.

## Submission
Please submit your results in the two-column (grapheme sequence, tab-character, tokenized phone sequence) TSV format, the same one used for the training and development data. If you use an internal representation other than NFC, you must convert back before submitting.

Please use email results, models repos, and instructions for validation to sig2p2024@gmail.com.

## Baseline
For baseline architectures, we are hosting a fork of the City University of New York CompLing lab's Yoyodyne project. Inspired by fairseq, Yoyodyne is a Pytorch-Lightning wrapper specialized for string transduction tasks. It hosts both general NLP architectures (LSTM, Transformer) along with models specialized for word level transduction (EditAction Transducer, Feature-invariant Transformers). Baseline architectures and the scripts for training are:

- Edit-Action Transducer [4,5]: `yoyodyne/examples/baselines/transducer.sh`
- Feature-invariant Transformer [6]: `yoyodyne/examples/baselines/transformer.sh`
- LSTM with Attention [1]: `yoyodyne/examples/baselines/attentive_lstm.sh`

Model architectures are largely equivalent and are intended to be run on a conventional consumer-level GPU or CPU. Interested participants are welcomed to build off the architectures or utilize other models available in the codebase (see `yoyodyne/README.md` for further details).

All models may be evaluated using the `yoyodyne/examples/baselines/predict.sh` script, requiring only changes to the `arch` flag.

## Organizers
The task is organized by members of the Computational Linguistics Lab at the [Graduate Center, City University of New York](https://www.gc.cuny.edu/) and the [University of British Columbia]().
